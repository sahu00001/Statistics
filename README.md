# Showcasing My Statistical Work

This repository showcases my master's work in statistics, covering fundamental concepts in **probability** and **statistical inference** with practical applications to engineering and data modeling. Topics include counting methods, random variables, sampling distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, nonparametric statistics, and goodness-of-fit testing. You'll also find examples demonstrating the use of **Excel** for solving statistical problems and the statistical software package **R** for addressing basic statistics and preparing for advanced coursework. Designed for learners with a calculus background (differentiation and integration), this repository provides structured problems and solutions, making it an excellent resource for building a strong foundation in statistical methods and modeling.

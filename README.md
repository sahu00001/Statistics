# Course description
This course provides fundamental concepts in probability and statistical
inference, with application to engineering contexts. Probability topics include counting
methods, discrete and continuous random variables, and their associated distributions.
Statistical inference topics include sampling distributions, point estimation, confidence intervals
and hypothesis testing for single- and two-sample experiments, nonparametric statistics, and
goodness-of-fit testing. Excel will be used to demonstrate how to solve some class examples,
and you'll be expected to use Excel to solve some homework problems. The statistical software
package R will be introduced to address basic statistics problems and to prepare you for future
coursework. Course prerequisites include calculus (differentiation and integration).
